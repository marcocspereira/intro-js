        <h1>BMI calculator</h1>
        Mark and John want to compare their BMIs. Let's now implement the functionality with objects and methods.
        <ol>
            <li>For each of them (Mark and John), create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height</li>
            <li>Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.</li>
            <li>In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.</li>
        </ol>
        Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in <b>kg</b> and height in <b>meter</b>).
