        <h1>Tip Calculator</h1>
        John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were:
        <ul>
            <li>$124,</li>
            <li> $48</li>
            <li>and $268.</li>
        </ul>
        To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).<br><br>
        He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.<br><br>
        In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
        <ol>
            <li>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
            <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
        </ol>
        (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
        <br><br>
