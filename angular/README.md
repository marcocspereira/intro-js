# Angular

It is just the [tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) from angular.io.

## Alley Fight

This mini project in Ruby-on-Rails is the API that feeds angular-tour-of-heroes angular project.

After clone the project, the first time you want to run it, you have to config this API to be OK to run. So, you need to open a console and:

- run bundle:

```shell
$ bundle
```

- create two environment files, for `development` (named `.env.development`) and `test` (named `.env.test`):

```ỳaml
export RAILS_DB_PASSWORD="<your_db_>"
export RAILS_DB_USERNAME="<your_db_username>"
export RDS_HOST="..."
export RDS_PORT="..."
```

Then, run the following commands to create and populate your database:

```shell
$ rails db:drop && rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
```

To run (uses port `3000` by default):

```shell
$ rails s
```

### Tests

Run:

```shell
$ rspec
```

## Angular Tour of Heroes

This mini project is the Angular frontend project.

Beware that you need to update the `_apiUrl`. At the moment it exists in each `.service.ts` that communicates with `àpi.service.ts`. Best scenario should use `environment.ts` files.

To run (uses port `4200` by default):

```shell
$ ng serve
```

### Tests

You need to update the browser that Karma will use. At the moment is Chromium. To update, go to `karma.conf.ts` and update `browsers` entry.

Then, to run:

```shell
$ ng test
```

It will open a browser window to run each implemented test, displaying coverage information in the command line.
